# Handwritten Digit Recognition

This project attempts to recognize handwritten digits through neural network.

- After drawing a digit from 0-9, the model can be run.
- It will output a prediction from the drawing with a confidence interval.

## Implementation
1. Obtained a training dataset with over 70,000 handwritten digits alongside their actual value from [the MNIST database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database).
2. Divided the dataset into a 6:1 training : test ratio.
3. Flattened the 28X28 image into 784 input nodes.
4. Developed multiple processing layers using [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/).
5. Created an interactive, graphical frontend using [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/).

## Functionality
Following is an example of the interface:
